Description: Hidden second-order stationarity is a generalization of second-order
    stationarity. This comprises a wide class of both homogeneous and 
    inhomogeneous models. 
        An addition to the spatstat package, this package contributes functions 
    for the analysis of homogeneous and inhomogeneous spatial point patterns that 
    have been proposed in the paper "Inhomogeneous spatial point processes with 
    hidden second-order stationarity" by Ute Hahn and Eva B. Vedel Jensen (2013),
    where hidden secon-order stationarity is defined. By contrast to spatstat, 
    sostatpp provides a unified approach to the different types of inhomogeneity.
        To this point it includes reweighted, retransformed and rescaled versions 
    of Ripley's K-function and the L-function, the directional K function 
    DeltaKdir,  and a framework for permutation tests. The package also supplies 
    the data set scholtzia, which is not included in package spatstat.
        As of spatstat version 1.42, the permutation tests are now (in different 
    form) also available in spatstat.
