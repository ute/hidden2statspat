Description: A package on top of spatstat, contributing functions for
    the analysis of homogeneous and inhomogeneous spatial point patterns 
    with hidden second-order stationarity.
    To this point it includes reweighted, retransformed and rescaled
    versions of Ripley's K-function, and a framework for permutation
    tests, as described in the paper "Inhomogeneous spatial point
    processes with hidden second-order stationarity" by Ute Hahn and
    Eva B. Vedel Jensen (2013). The package also supplies the data
    set scholtzia, which is not included in package spatstat.
