Title: Analysis of hidden second-order stationary point processes

Depends: R (>= 3.0), spatstat (>= 1.31)
Imports: spatstat
Description: A package on top of spatstat, contributing functions for 
    the analysis of inhomogeneous spatial point patterns with hidden 
    second-order stationarity. 
    To this point it includes reweighted, retransformed and rescaled 
    versions of Ripley's K-function, and a framework for permutation 
    tests, as described in the paper "Inhomogeneous spatial point 
    processes with hidden second-order stationarity" by Ute Hahn and
    Eva B. Vedel Jensen (2013). The package also supplies the data
    analysed there, unless included in package spatstat.
