  CHANGES IN sostatpp VERSION 0.10.0
  
    o utilities for plotting have been replaced by separate package plottools
      with extra functionality

    o new methods for ppsample:
      plot
      subsampling with [
 
  CHANGES IN sostatpp VERSION 0.9.2
  
    o coordTransformation now accepts transformation functions with extra 
      arguments
  
  CHANGES IN sostatpp VERSION 0.9.1
    
    o new functions: 
      is.ppsample, 
      backtransformed.ppsample

    o changed internal element names of class sostyppp

  CHANGES IN sostatpp VERSION 0.9.0

    o new class ppsample with generator quadratsubsample

  CHANGES IN sostatpp VERSION 0.8.4
    
    o new function lplot: plotting objects in a list
    plot arguments may be also given as named lists, thus assigning the designated
    parameters to the objects in the list.
    
    o helper function retagList
    

  CHANGES IN sostatpp VERSION 0.8.3

    o transition to new class for s.o.s. planar point patterns
    The class definition for second-order stationarity type tagged planar point 
    patterns has been largely reorganized, therefore the name change from 
    sostpp to sostyppp

    o improved backtransformation of retransformed s.o.s. point processes
    When a point pattern is tagged retransformed with gradient, the transform and
    backtransform are approximated by interpolation (using approxfun)
    Rectangular windows are preserved in gradient transformation. 

    o no argument tquads in functions estOnQuadrats and Kpermute.test 
    Due to improvement in retrieving the original window in function backtransform,
    it is no longer necessary to provide the backtransformed window in functions
    estOnQuadrats and Kpermute.test
