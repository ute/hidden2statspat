    CHANGES IN sostatpp VERSION 0.8.3

OVERVIEW

    o transition to new class for s.o.s. planar point patterns

    o improved backtransformation of retransformed s.o.s. point processes


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o class sostyppp
    The class definition for second-order stationarity type tagged planar point 
    patterns has been largely reorganized, therefore the name change from 
    sostpp to sostyppp

    o no argument tquads in functions estOnQuadrats and Kpermute.test 
    Due to improvement in retrieving the original window in function backtransform,
    it is no longer necessary to provide the backtransformed window in functions
    estOnQuadrats and Kpermute.test
