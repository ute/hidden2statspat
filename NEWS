  CHANGES IN sostatpp VERSION 0.12.0

    o new function estK that return a funsample object (which is essentially
      a function with list properties)

  CHANGES IN sostatpp VERSION 0.11.4

    o type information is no longer stored as list element, but as attribute

    o simplified encoding of type - just a plain character variable (was 
      encrypted to save space when storing as marks in a very early version)

  CHANGES IN sostatpp VERSION 0.11.3

    o quadratsplot for backtransformed patterns

    o backtransform is a generic function now, with methods for sostyppp and ppsample

    o updated demo files (data analysis from H&J 2013)

    o updated package documentation

    o extract.fdsample now tolerates small differences in argument (numerical effects)

  CHANGES IN sostatpp VERSION 0.11.2

    o renamed estK, estL, estDeltaKdir to K.est, L.est, DeltaKdir.est to stress
      similarity to spatstat, since these functions return fv-objects
    
    o removed obsolete functions like Kpermute.test

    o adjustments in the documentation

  CHANGES IN sostatpp VERSION 0.11.1

    o new plot function for class Ktest
    
    o function quadratsplot completely rewritten, with changed call
    
    o some fixes

  CHANGES IN sostatpp VERSION 0.11.0

    o new functions twosample.K.test and sos.test, to replace Kpermute.test

    o new class Ktest

  CHANGES IN sostatpp VERSION 0.10.1
  
    o new function quadratsets.hilo: makes sets of test quadrats

    o fixed: subsetting of sostyppp objects behaved different for marked and
      unmarked patterns


  CHANGES IN sostatpp VERSION 0.10.0
  
    o utilities for plotting have been replaced by separate package plottools
      with extra functionality

    o new methods for ppsample:
      plot
      subsampling with [

    o quadratsubsample renamed to ppsubsample
    
    o a number of fixes
 
  CHANGES IN sostatpp VERSION 0.9.2
  
    o coordTransformation now accepts transformation functions with extra 
      arguments
  
  CHANGES IN sostatpp VERSION 0.9.1
    
    o new functions: 
      is.ppsample, 
      backtransformed.ppsample

    o changed internal element names of class sostyppp

  CHANGES IN sostatpp VERSION 0.9.0

    o new class ppsample with generator quadratsubsample

  CHANGES IN sostatpp VERSION 0.8.4
    
    o new function lplot: plotting objects in a list
    plot arguments may be also given as named lists, thus assigning the designated
    parameters to the objects in the list.
    
    o helper function retagList
    

  CHANGES IN sostatpp VERSION 0.8.3

    o transition to new class for s.o.s. planar point patterns
    The class definition for second-order stationarity type tagged planar point 
    patterns has been largely reorganized, therefore the name change from 
    sostpp to sostyppp

    o improved backtransformation of retransformed s.o.s. point processes
    When a point pattern is tagged retransformed with gradient, the transform and
    backtransform are approximated by interpolation (using approxfun)
    Rectangular windows are preserved in gradient transformation. 

    o no argument tquads in functions estOnQuadrats and Kpermute.test 
    Due to improvement in retrieving the original window in function backtransform,
    it is no longer necessary to provide the backtransformed window in functions
    estOnQuadrats and Kpermute.test
